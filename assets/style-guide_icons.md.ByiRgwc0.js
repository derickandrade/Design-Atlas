This choice was made due to the wide range of consistent, accessible, and well-documented symbols, developed and maintained by Google. The icons follow the design principles of <a href="https://m3.material.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Material Design</a>, which emphasize simple shapes, legibility at various sizes, visual clarity, and adaptability across international contexts.</p><p>All icons are vector-based, scalable, and optimized for high-resolution displays. Atlas primarily adopts the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.style=Rounded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Rounded</strong></a> style, which offers a balance between visual lightness and recognizability. However, other styles such as <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.style=Outlined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Outlined</strong></a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.style=Sharp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Sharp</strong></a>, or <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&amp;icon.style=Filled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Filled</strong></a> may also be used depending on contrast, visual weight, or functional context.</p><p>The library supports CSS customization (such as color, size, and weight), making it easy to apply in responsive interfaces and reusable components like buttons, menus, or status indicators.</p><p>Using Material Symbols also ensures automatic support for reading directions (LTR and RTL), improving accessibility and internationalization. All icons used in Atlas are available in the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">official Figma community file</a> and can be referenced directly by developers via symbol codes in <a href="https://github.com/google/material-design-icons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">optimized SVG format</a>.</p>',5)]))}const f=t(i,[["render",n]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
