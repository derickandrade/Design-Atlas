For example, content about bike lanes should include relevant imagery of cyclists, infrastructure, or signage that supports and enriches the information.</li><li><strong>Neutral point of view</strong> – Visuals should maintain objectivity. Avoid dramatized or emotionally charged images unless clearly needed for context.</li><li><strong>Use the most accurate medium</strong> – Use realistic photos when representing real-world objects, places, or people. Illustrations or icons should be used intentionally to simplify or symbolize concepts.</li><li><strong>High resolution and quality</strong> – Images should be clear, well-composed, and optimized for both print and screen use.</li><li><strong>Respect for copyright</strong> – Only use media with the proper license. Prefer Creative Commons, Public Domain, or materials hosted on <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wikimedia Commons</a> and other open-license platforms that comply with copyright guidelines.</li></ul><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Important</p><p>We don&#39;t have an official illustration library in Atlas yet, but you can help change that!
