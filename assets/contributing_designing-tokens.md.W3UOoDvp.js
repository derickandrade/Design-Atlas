This is in order to validate that this new token is really needed, and to plan next steps. Make sure to add the Design Tokens project tag to the task for visibility. You can also post a comment in the task and ping the DST members as a way to start the conversation.</p><p>Once the task is validated with the DST and the need is clear, you’ll be able to start designing the new system token.</p><h2 id="_2-research-and-prepare" tabindex="-1">2. Research and prepare <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-research-and-prepare" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.

This process allows designers to understand the extent to which the new token will be reused. Also, tokens within the same category will need to be observed: the new token will have to fit into the existing scale.</p><h2 id="_3-design-the-token" tabindex="-1">3.

Create option and decision tokens&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Designers will need to add both option and decision tokens in their respective specifications sheets. Option tokens consume “raw” values (e.g. <code>#57814c</code>), and usually have more abstract names (e.g. <code>olive-500</code>). The names of decision tokens should express their intended use (e.g. <code>color-accent</code>). They consume option tokens as values. Learn more about the different <a href="./../design-tokens/definition-and-structure.html">token typologies</a>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="theme style sheet example"></p><p>Make sure that both option and decision tokens fit within the existing value scale. Apply the value of the token to its “swatch” in Figma in order to showcase the new style. Also, make sure to use the right naming, which might depend on the token’s category.</p><h3 id="_3-2-evaluate-and-iterate" tabindex="-1">3.2.
