Chinese and Japanese also follow the LTR system in digital experiences, although they traditionally use top-to-bottom and RTL directions in printing and writing. Conversely, languages with right-to-left directionality (RTL), such as Arabic or Hebrew, are read from right to left.</p><h2 id="mirroring-behavior" tabindex="-1">Mirroring behavior <a class="header-anchor" href="#mirroring-behavior" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Mirroring behavior&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When a layout translates from LTR to RTL, or vice versa, this process is called mirroring, as it essentially reflects the layout orientation of the opposite directionality.</p><p>When mirroring a layout, it&#39;s important to note that not all elements in the interface will use the same mirroring treatment.

However, numbers and icons representing time will not be mirrored.</p><p><strong>Do:</strong></p><ul><li>Adapt date and time elements with each language&#39;s reading direction.</li><li>Use the appropriate date and time formats for each language.</li></ul><p><strong>Don&#39;t:</strong></p><ul><li>Mirror the order of date and time elements, as it may lead to confusion in interpretation.</li><li>Mirror numerical values.</li><li>Mirror icons representing time.</li></ul><h2 id="lists" tabindex="-1"><strong>Lists</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#lists" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Lists**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In a list, all rows should align according to the language direction of the browser or the article.</p><p><strong>Do:</strong></p><ul><li>Align all rows of the list according to the language direction of the browser or article.</li><li>Keep the alignment consistent while ensuring each item has the correct language and direction attributes.</li></ul><p><strong>Don&#39;t:</strong></p><ul><li>Mix alignments within a list, as this can cause confusion for readers.</li></ul><h2 id="progress-elements" tabindex="-1">Progress elements <a class="header-anchor" href="#progress-elements" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Progress elements&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When mirroring progress elements, only the ones related to sequences should be mirrored.</p><p><strong>Do:</strong></p><ul><li>Mirror progress elements when they indicate progress or steps, aligning the sequence with the reading direction of each language for consistency.</li></ul><p><strong>Don&#39;t:</strong></p><ul><li>Mirror progress elements when they relate to time, such as the timeline within a video player.</li></ul><h2 id="images" tabindex="-1">Images <a class="header-anchor" href="#images" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Images&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The original orientation of images and illustrations will not be mirrored.
